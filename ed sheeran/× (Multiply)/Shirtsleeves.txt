I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You値l be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you値l be floating away

And I値l hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I知 captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won稚 dry
I値l wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I値l wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make-up
I値l never trust you again
You can just be a friend

And I値l hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I知 captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won稚 dry
I値l wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I値l wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I
I知 on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I知-
I知 drowning in the oceans you made

When salted tears won稚 dry
I値l wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I値l wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
